This week I got too excited.

After doing the labs the idea of doing a piano was stuck in my head, the part regarding the board was not as challenging as the coding. I had a couple issues when trying to make the LEDs and input wires work properly. But the bulk of the issue was with the coding. 

Finally the end result was a ‘if-ception’ where I added 2 if statements that established the state of the keys, and then the note.

At the same time, to be able to change slightly the tone of each note I added a variable to each tone so the potentiometer can change by 50 points the frequency.

Once the “keyboard” was fully functional I tried placing it inside a one-use coffee cup. To make this short I’ll just say that I leant two lessons from this; the basics of soldering, and that planning rules in this kind of situations.
