_This is a retrospective, AKA postmortem of what was it like to create **Metaroruim.** Done for a class at **ITP** called **"Pop-up Window Displays"**. Metatorium was located at the [NYU Broadway Windows](https://www.google.com/maps/place/40°43'54.9%22N+73°59'29.7%22W/@40.731923,-73.992312,18z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x0:0x0!7e2!8m2!3d40.7319232!4d-73.9915898)._

_A project done alongside 3 other people; [Regina Cantú](http://www.reginacantu.com/), [Alexia Kyriakopoulos](), and [Ari Meliciano](http://www.ariciano.com). It goes without saying that this post is from my point of view of the experience._

# Origin Story

The main idea behind this was an observation post, a place where people could observe themselves and others, we wanted to play with the obsession most people unconsciously have towards themselves.

With that in mind I came up with a basic prototype to be able to test out the interaction.

For the last couple months I had personally been very interested in face detection, but the project to apply this never came, until this one. it was a good chance to try it.

A screen was set up to show a mirrored image of a webcam footage, this way people would see themselves and maybe, react to it. The footage above is a portion of the images taken during said test. This was not only a mirror, but a **python** script that with [openCV]() would take captures every _x_ amount of seconds.

From this captures, **openCV** would look for faces, and if one was found, it would crop it and save it in a different folder.

_I am fully aware of the absence of any kind of technical explanation here. [Soon enough]() that will be fixed. I will explain the very basics of **openCV** and how we made use of it for the setup we had._

## Success!

The test was very successful, people flocked around it, even if nothing was apparently happening, they would still be there. I indeed took images and cropped them but that first time I didn't do anything with them.

We realized that we needed some kind of response/reward for being there, besides just seeing your face in a big screen. So we made use of those cropped images.

The next time we set up the application a window was added showing the last image cropped. For obvious reasons the results were even better.
