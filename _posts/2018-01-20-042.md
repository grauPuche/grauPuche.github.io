_This is a retrospective, AKA postmortem of what was it like to create **Metaroruim.**_

_A project done alongside 3 other people; [Regina Cant√∫](http://www.reginacantu.com/), [Alexia Kyriakopoulos](), and [Ari Meliciano](http://www.ariciano.com). It goes without saying that this post is from my point of view of the experience._

This project was done for a class at ITP called _"Pop-up Window Displays"_. Metatorium was located in a corner building at broadway and 10th.

The main idea behind this was an observation post, a place where people could observe themselves and others, we wanted to play with the obsession most people unconsciously have towards themselves.

With that in mind I came up with a basic prototype to be able to test out the interaction.
