_This is a retrospective, AKA postmortem of what was it like to create **Metaroruim.** Done for a class at **ITP** called **"Pop-up Window Displays"**. Metatorium was located at the [NYU Broadway Windows](https://www.google.com/maps/place/40°43'54.9%22N+73°59'29.7%22W/@40.731923,-73.992312,18z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x0:0x0!7e2!8m2!3d40.7319232!4d-73.9915898)._

_A project done alongside 3 other people; [Regina Cantú](http://www.reginacantu.com/), [Alexia Kyriakopoulos](http://www.alexiak.com), and [Ari Meliciano](http://www.ariciano.com). It goes without saying that this post is from my point of view of the experience._

# Origin Story

The main idea behind this was an observation post, a place where people could observe themselves and others, we wanted to play with the obsession most people unconsciously have towards themselves.

With that in mind I came up with a basic prototype to be able to test out the interaction.

For the last couple months I had personally been very interested in face detection, but the project to apply this never came, until this one. it was a good chance to try it.

A screen was set up to show a mirrored image of a webcam footage, this way people would see themselves and maybe, react to it. The footage above is a portion of the images taken during said test. This was not only a mirror, but a **python** script that with [openCV]() would take captures every _x_ amount of seconds.

From this captures, **openCV** would look for faces, and if one was found, it would crop it and save it in a different folder.

_I am fully aware of the absence of any kind of technical explanation here. [Soon enough]() that will be fixed. I will explain the very basics of **openCV** and how we made use of it for the setup we had._

## Success!

The test was very successful, people flocked around it, even if nothing was apparently happening, they would still be there. I indeed took images and cropped them but that first time I didn't do anything with them.

We realized that we needed some kind of response/reward for being there, besides just seeing your face in a big screen. So we made use of those cropped images.

The next time we set up the application a window was added showing the last image cropped. For obvious reasons the results were even better.

Surely, people used the "mirror" even more, and we observed that they would come back to have their face on the screen again.

At this point, what was being used to display the last faced that had been cropped, was a new window created with **openCV**, that showed to be quite problematic and the main cause for _crashing the script when more than 1 face was found_ in a picture taken.

Said crash would not stop the whole process, but only part if ot, meaning that it would get stuck in a loop checking for faces in the same capture.

This was not the only problem we had, the detection was not precise enough, it would get stuck thinking that a piece of furniture or a smudge in the floor were faces. _This was ajusted throught the settings, but there was always that sneaky shadow that would still be there._

# Building it

Now we knew how the interaction was, so the work was needed for this interaction was going to be shown.

Coming back to the idea of an observation post, lost of plausible representations came to mind, but the one that stuck, was the vision of a **plant-like organism** that would feed itself from faces, meaning that instead of sunlight, this plant would need people and their faces. The aura of this was a _tech induced plant_. With iridescent leafs, light producing branches, and screens as flowers.

## Back end

This plant-like thing that has screens as flowers, needs a lot of them, and a Mac Mini can handle so many. That meant having 1 mac mini for each 2 displays. at one point we were planing to have up to 8 screens but that happened to be obviously too much.
