# What is this for

Learning _web development_ in this day and age is something that lots of people are already doing, but we only know half of it. We only dive into the client-side end of the deal, so we know how to use HTML and javascript, but server-side is never mentioned.

So this is what this is for, what is a server, what it does and why should you even think about them.

# Let the nerds take care of that.

To that I would say no, a server is basically a computer somewhere that stores information that when requested, gets 'served' to the client. That is basically how the internet works, A bunch of computers in places giving you stuff when you ask for it. 

A fairly easy action that besides its value most people that work in projects that require a service like this don't really know the basics of it.

So here we are, trying to tell you what this is and how to set up an environment for you to play around with all this. 

# Digital Ocean

Either you left cause you don't care about this or you wanna work in this soon to be nightmare.

So lets dive into [digitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com) (get it?).

## droplets.

A droplet is virtual computer. An emulation of an actual computer set up inside a real much more powerful machine. this allows getting your hands into a computer very fast and easily. In this case one with a public IP and and a easy access from anywhere. This allows to create servers and to put them up in no time.

That is what we are going to use to create the server and play around with [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and NginX.

Getting a droplet up and running is pretty quick, just go to [digitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com) sing up.

Having a droplet costs money but luckily if you have a **.edu** email linked to your github account you can get a **$50 credit** thanks to the [GitHub Education Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) . If you don't have a .edu email can get **$10** [here](https://m.do.co/c/50edef5599af) .

 _all this only works if you have never used digitalOcean._ 

Go get your free money (I'll be here waiting)

Once you have your code, just go to the billing section on settings and look for the window where to add the code. You should be notified once added.

So... You have money to get a droplet up and running now. Creating a droplet is fairly simple, you go to the create tab, select droplets, and then you set it up.

We are going to be using the basic **Ubuntu** **16.04.3 x64 ** system and the **$5 per month** option. You can upgrade later on if you wish to do so. The rest of info is not relevant right now, so you can leave the default settings.

Congratulations you have your first VPS up and running.

# SSH

Secure Shell is what we are going to be using to access our server, this allows us to access a computer on a secure way through a insecure network.

ssh is done through the command line; and to do that you need your server IP and the user name. If you have followed everything properly if you go to your email you should have received and email form digitalOcean giving you your access info.

It should look like this

Now that you have that information open terminal and do the following:

    ssh root@111.222.333.444

after that you are gonna be asked for your password and then you will be asked to change it again. because you know. sending passwords via email is not the best of ideas.

# new user

 **root ** is the the main user in a OS, so it is not a very good idea to be playing around with it, specially if you are a novice like we are.

This means that the standard procedure is to create a new user every time you start a new system.

    adduser _username_

Not all users are born equal so new ones do not have the same privileges as the root user. But to proceed we need to give **sudo** privileges to the new user so we can use it almost as the same way as the root user.

    usermod -aG sudo _username_

now the new user has a better chance at changing the system, it is more powerful, as long as you use "sudo" before those commands that require sudo privileges.

 _If you want to make your system a bit more secure you should generate a ssh-key. check [this tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-16-04) for that_ .

now that you have the new user up and running, logout and ssh again with the new user.

    ssh _newuser_@111.222.333.444
