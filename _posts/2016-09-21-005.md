I decided to keep with my previous image and go from there, what my intention was at the beginning was being able to reduce the amount of lines by creating an for loop that automatically created all the shapes at the same time of changing their color gradually, I did not find a definitive way of doing so, and the movement was very hard to accomplish due to it being at the same pace in both ways. 

The random elements are the background that has to refresh constantly so the appearing text does not stay printed permanently on the back of the spheres. 

To state all the actions; the constant movement of the circles, the changing background and the text when pressing mouse
