To create this artwork or Sketch Bryan and I decided to combine characteristics of our previous assignments by combining the color changing of the fill in Bryan's work and the shrinking circles on mine. That way we created a grid with circles that follow the mouse position.

The added controls are the ability of changing the size of the circles by pressing or releasing the mouse button and pressing any key on the keyboard to stop the movement. The color of the circles varies depending on the position of the mouse in the artboard.
