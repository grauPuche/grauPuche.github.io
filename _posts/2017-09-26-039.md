*howFar is a node js application/script that provides the distance between the user and any website server.*

The way it works is by geo-locating any website through its IP address and calculating the distance between these. It's very simple. 

This was an assignment of the [understanding networks][a1] class and its purpose id to illustrate the distance that data physically travels every time you visit a website.

*me trying to filter information*

To get all this information, I first tried to read out of the `traceroute` command but my end goal was to have the whole system in one command and one prompt. My skill level at this point is not as high as I would like it to be for this type of script, so instead of reading all the IP and doing some kind of command line inception I rather go back to my known friend node and find some packages that get me the same end result

{% highlight javascript%}

var geodist = require('geodist');
var where = require('node-where');
const dns = require('dns');
const extIP = require('external-ip');

{% endhighlight%}

the code is available at my [GitHub][a2] and you can play around with it.
